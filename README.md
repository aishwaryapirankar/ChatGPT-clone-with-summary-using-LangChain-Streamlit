## Overview

ChatGPT is a popular language model developed by OpenAI. This project replicates some of its functionality using LangChain, a library for creating conversational AI applications, and Streamlit, a framework for building web applications.

Key features of this repository include:

1. **ChatGPT-like Conversations**: You can have conversations with the model by sending a series of text messages. The model responds to these messages, creating a chat-like interaction.

2. **Summarization**: This ChatGPT clone has a built-in feature for summarizing conversations. This means you can request a summary of the conversation, and the model will provide a concise summary of the entire chat.

3. **Streamlit Web Application**: The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the ChatGPT clone in your web browser.

4. **LangChain Backend**: LangChain is used as the backend to power the conversational AI. It handles the logic for processing and responding to user messages.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatGPT-clone-with-summary-using-LangChain-Streamlit.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ChatGPT-clone-with-summary-using-LangChain-Streamlit
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```shell
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The application should now be accessible in your web browser at `https://chatgpt-clone-with-summary-using-langchain-app-by-ap.streamlit.app/`.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser by following the installation steps.

2. Start a conversation by typing messages in the chat input box. The model will respond to your messages.

3. To request a summary of the conversation, click the "Get Summary" button. The model will generate a summary of the conversation so far.

4. You can continue the conversation, and the model will maintain context and provide relevant responses.
