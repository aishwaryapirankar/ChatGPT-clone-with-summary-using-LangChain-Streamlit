# ChatGPT Clone with Summary using LangChain and Streamlit

This GitHub repository contains a simple implementation of a ChatGPT clone with a summary feature using LangChain and Streamlit. This project is designed to demonstrate how to create a conversational AI application that can generate summaries of conversations with users. 

## Overview

ChatGPT is a popular language model developed by OpenAI. This project replicates some of its functionality using LangChain, a library for creating conversational AI applications, and Streamlit, a framework for building web applications.

Key features of this repository include:

1. **ChatGPT-like Conversations**: You can have conversations with the model by sending a series of text messages. The model responds to these messages, creating a chat-like interaction.

2. **Summarization**: This ChatGPT clone has a built-in feature for summarizing conversations. This means you can request a summary of the conversation, and the model will provide a concise summary of the entire chat.

3. **Streamlit Web Application**: The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the ChatGPT clone in your web browser.

4. **LangChain Backend**: LangChain is used as the backend to power the conversational AI. It handles the logic for processing and responding to user messages.


The application should now be accessible in your web browser at https://chatgpt-clone-with-summary-using-langchain-app-by-ap.streamlit.app/](https://chatgpt-clone-with-summary-using-langchain-app-by-ap.streamlit.app/
